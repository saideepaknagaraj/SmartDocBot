# 📚 QueryForge

**QueryForge** is an intelligent document query engine that blends modern language models with vector search to answer user questions based on custom document inputs.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before diving in, ensure your system is ready with the following:

- ✅ Python 3.6+
- 📦 Python packages:
  - `langchain`
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `faiss`
  - `PyPDF2` (for handling PDF inputs)
  - `python-dotenv` (to manage environment variables)

---

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/QueryForge.git
   cd QueryForge
   ```

2. **(Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Model & Data Setup**

   - Download or configure your preferred language model and vector index.
   - Follow [LangChain's official setup guide](https://docs.langchain.com/) to complete this step.

5. **Environment Configuration**

   - Define paths like `DB_FAISS_PATH` in a `.env` file or directly within your script settings.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Once everything is installed and configured:

1. Update all necessary paths and variables (`DB_FAISS_PATH`, model checkpoints, etc.).
2. Run the main Python script or integrate the logic into your existing backend.
3. QueryForge will parse your documents and respond to natural language questions based on their content.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. Start the script or service.
2. Submit a question about the content of your documents.
3. QueryForge retrieves relevant info using semantic search + LLM reasoning.
4. It returns an answer — optionally including reference snippets or sources.
5. You can fine-tune or modify behavior to fit your use case.
